# Sentiment-Analysis
This was a project for our course "Data Structures and Algorithms" in which we developed an algorithm that could determine the sentiment in a sentence. We used the NLTK library available in python and the movie reviews data set, which is part of the library, was used to train the algorithm. 
# Disclaimer:
For the proper working of the all the codes in this file, you will need to install python 3.6 32 bit and these libraries on your systems:

Libraries:
--> NLTK


After the installation of NLTK, type 'import nltk' in idle interactive mode and click enter. Then type nltk.download('movie_reviews') and click enter.
Then type nltk.download('stopwords') and click enter. Then type nltk.download('punkt') and click enter.


This should be enough to run the code successfully. If any errors are encountered then please ask any one of our group members.
